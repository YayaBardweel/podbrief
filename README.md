**PodBrief** is a podcast summary tool designed to save users time by summarizing podcast transcripts with the help of AI. It allows users to paste long podcast transcripts, and the app generates concise summaries. The app integrates with **Ollama** for enhanced summaries using the **Llama 3.2** model, providing an AI-powered solution for podcast listeners who want to stay informed but don't have time to listen to every episode.
